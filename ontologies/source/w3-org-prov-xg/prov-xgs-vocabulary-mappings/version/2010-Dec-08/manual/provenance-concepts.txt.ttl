<> a owl:Ontology;
rdfs:comment """The proposed Working Group will leverage the activities of the W3C Provenance Incubator Group, its understanding of the state-of-the-art, extensive requirements capture, use cases and flagship scenarios, and mapping of provenance vocabularies.
Drawing on existing vocabularies/ontologies (namely: Changeset Vocabulary, Dublin Core, Open Provenance Model (OPM), PREMIS, Proof Markup Language (PML), Provenance Vocabulary, Provenir ontology, SWAN Provenance Ontology, Semantic Web Publishing Vocabulary, WOT Schema), a set of concepts have been identified to constitute the core of a standard provenance interchange language. The number of concepts is intentionally limited, so as to ensure a cohesive and tractable core. Other concepts can be relevant to provenance, but it is anticipated that they would be defined by means of the envisaged extension mechanism of the provenance interchange language.
In the following list, the names appearing as titles are used for intuition. Concepts with similar intuition in existing vocabularies are provided. Examples from one of the three flagship scenarios from the W3C Provenance Incubator Group are also shown.""";
