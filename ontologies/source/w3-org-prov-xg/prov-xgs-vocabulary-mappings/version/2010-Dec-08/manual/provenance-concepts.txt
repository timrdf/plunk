The proposed Working Group will leverage the activities of the W3C Provenance Incubator Group, its understanding of the state-of-the-art, extensive requirements capture, use cases and flagship scenarios, and mapping of provenance vocabularies.
Drawing on existing vocabularies/ontologies (namely: Changeset Vocabulary, Dublin Core, Open Provenance Model (OPM), PREMIS, Proof Markup Language (PML), Provenance Vocabulary, Provenir ontology, SWAN Provenance Ontology, Semantic Web Publishing Vocabulary, WOT Schema), a set of concepts have been identified to constitute the core of a standard provenance interchange language. The number of concepts is intentionally limited, so as to ensure a cohesive and tractable core. Other concepts can be relevant to provenance, but it is anticipated that they would be defined by means of the envisaged extension mechanism of the provenance interchange language.
In the following list, the names appearing as titles are used for intuition. Concepts with similar intuition in existing vocabularies are provided. Examples from one of the three flagship scenarios from the W3C Provenance Incubator Group are also shown.
1. Resource: Note that it includes static or dynamic (mutable or immutable), the proposed Working Group can decide whether to subclass this and make a distinction.
opm:Artifact, pmlp:IdentifiedThing, provenir:data, "continuant" (obo:BFO_0000002), pmlp:Document, pmlp:DocumentFragment
Example: BlogAgg would like to know the state of an image before and after modification to see if it was modified appropriately
may include a user query (eg pmlp:Query) 2. Process execution: refers to execution of a computation, workflow,
program, service, etc. Does not refer to a query. opm:Process, provenir:process, "process" (obo:BFO_0000007)
Example: Alice collects data from public sources and "natural experiment" data. Alice then processes and interprets the results and writes a report summarizing the conclusions. All these steps should be captured.
3. Recipe link: we will not define what the recipe is, what we mean here is just a standard way to refer to a recipe (a pointer). The development of standard ways to describe these recipes is out of scope.
pmlp:InferenceRule, pmlp:DeclarativeRule, pmlp:MethodRule, "function" (obo:BFO_0000034)
Example: Alice is processing data and executes a linear regression implementation as one of the steps, the recipe could refer to a linear regression algorithm
4. Agent: entity (human or otherwise) involved in the process execution. An agent can be the creator or contributor
opm:Agent, provenir:agent, prv:Actor, pmlp:Agent Example: Alice starts and facilities the tool SPSS when doing

5. Role
data analysis.
opm:Role, "role" (obo:BFO_0000023) Example: Whether a data file was used as a training or test data set when running machine learning algorithms.
6. Location: a link to a description of location. Defining how the spatial information will be represented is out of scope, will point to an existing ontology.
provenir:spatial_parameter, provenir:located_in, provenir:adjacent_to Example: The location where the disease was declared.
7. Derivation opm:WasDerivedFrom, opm:WasDerivedFromStar, provenir:derives_from
Example: The thumbnail image was derived from the panda
image. 8. Generation
9. Use
opm:WasGeneratedBy, opm:WasGeneratedByStar, Example: A thumbnail image was generated by Blog Agg using the panda image.
opm:Used, opm:UsedStar, prv:usedBy Example: The panda image was used by BlogAgg to generate a thumbnail image. Example: John Markoff used SPSS
10. Ordering of Processes opm:WasTriggeredBy, provenir:preceded_by, provenir: preceded_by*
Example: Report writing was triggered by the interpretation of results. Example: Bob is a researcher of the flu epidemic starts a process to send email about the status of an (long-running) experiment process. The notification process is preceded by the experiment process.
11. Version dc:replaces, provenir:transformation_of, pmlp:SourceUsage
Example: When Alice releases a new report this would express that this version should be used rather than the previous one. Example: Alice consults a website URI whose content changes over time, a document that has versions going through edits, etc.
12. Participation provenir:has_participant, "participates in" (obo:BFO_0000056), "has participant" (obo:BFO_0000057), prv:involvedActor
Example: Alice participates in reviewing a paper and approving it for publication, she is not an author but participates in the process.
13. Control, is a subclass of participation. Related to this is a notion of "responsibility", i.e. an entity that stands behind the artifact that was produced (Alice controls the process but the organization that she worked for is responsible, so that even after she leaves the organization is still responsible). It may be a useful shortcut to add.
opm:WasControlledBy, prv:operatedBy

Example: SPSS was operated by Alice.
14. Provenance Container opm:OPMGraph, dc:provenance, pmlp:NodeSet
Example: Bob ́s Website Factory provides proof in the form of a set of provenance statements that the contract was executed as agreed.
15. Views or Accounts opm:Account
16. Time
Example: Bob ́s Website Factory and Customers Inc both provide two different and conflicting sets of information (i.e. accounts) describing the provenance of the production of the same website.
opm:Time, opm:Used, opm:WasGeneratedBy, opm:WasDerivedFrom, opm:wasControlledBy, prv:wasPerformedAt, dc:modified, provenir:has_temporal_value, provenir:temporal_parameter, "begins to exist during" (obo:BFO_0000068), "ceases to exist during" (obo:BFO_0000069), "temporal region" (obo:BFO_0000008)
Example: BlogAgg wants to find the correct originator of the microblog who first put the word out. Example: Alice performs quality checks on the data before analyzing it.
Example: The timestamp associated with a published dataset.
Example: The time when Alice modifies a previous report. 17. Collections: Should be a lightweight notion, mainly focused on "part of".
Might be treated as a resource ultimately. prv:containedBy, provenir:contained_in, provenir:contained_in, dc:hasPart
Example: A layer is part of an image Example: An image is contained in a news item Example: A report contains a data plot
