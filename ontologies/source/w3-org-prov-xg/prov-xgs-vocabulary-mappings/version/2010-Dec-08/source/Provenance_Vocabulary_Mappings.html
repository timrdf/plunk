</p><p><i>Description</i>: This document describes an initiative by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/wiki" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/wiki">W3C Provenance Incubator Group</a> to identify correspondence between a set of core provenance concepts defined in the Open Provenance Model (OPM) and other provenance terminologies. The document is expected to facilitate interoperability and help users better understand the commonalities and differences between OPM and other provenance terminologies. The mappings between the provenance terms are formally encoded using the W3C recommended <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)</a> vocabulary. This report also documents the rationale for the mappings.

<a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h1>
<p>The need for representing provenance information has led to the creation of a number of provenance models that cater to a diverse set of application domains. The provenance models often reflect the requirements of the user community that developed the model, for example the Open Provenance Model (OPM) was developed as a generic provenance model in context of workflow provenance whereas the Provenir ontology was developed as a upper-level provenance ontology for use in Semantic Web applications, and the Provenance Vocabulary was proposed for publishing provenance aware content using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">Linked Data (LD) principles</a>. Given the large number of such models it is useful to identify the correspondence between their respective provenance terms to, 
</p>
<ul><li> Help users better understand the similarities and differences between the provenance terminologies, 
</li><li> Facilitate the development of applications that can utilize the mappings for provenance interoperability, and 
</li><li> Enable the provenance research community to move towards the adoption of a common provenance terminology.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>This work has been done by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/wiki/Main_Page">Provenance Incubator Group</a>, part of the W3C Incubator Activity, with a charter to provide a state-of-the art understanding and develop a roadmap in the area of provenance for Semantic Web technologies, development, and possible standardization. The group's activities are public, and are recorded on the W3C Provenance Incubator Group <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>. The group agreed to document the mappings between existing provenance models and vocabularies at the first Face-to-Face <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/wiki/Prov_XG_Live#Face_to_Face_Meeting_April_25-26.2C_2010" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/wiki/Prov_XG_Live#Face_to_Face_Meeting_April_25-26.2C_2010">meeting</a> held on April 25-26, 2010.
</p>
<a name="Approach_and_Provenance_Terminologies" id="Approach_and_Provenance_Terminologies"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Approach and Provenance Terminologies</span></h1>
<p>The mappings are structured following the approach used to create the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mediaont-10/" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/mediaont-10/">Ontology for Media Resource 1.0</a> by the W3C Media Annotations Working Group.  Essentially, a reference model is selected and then all other vocabularies and models are mapped to it.  In the case of the media resource vocabularies, a new reference model was created, while here we agreed that it was best not to develop a new model but rather select an already existing one.  Another departure was our desire to use formal mappings using semantic relations when possible, rather than textual comments.
</p><p>We chose a core set of provenance vocabularies and models.  Some were chosen because they represent a significant community effort, others because they have significant adoption, others because they are well known in the community.  Others can be easily mapped following the same process that we established.  The core set selected for mapping includes:
</p>
<ul><li> Open Provenance Model 
</li><li> Provenir ontology
</li><li> Provenance Vocabulary
</li><li> Proof Markup Language
</li><li> Dublin Core
</li><li> PREMIS
</li><li> WOT Schema
</li><li> SWAN Provenance Ontology
</li><li> Semantic Web Publishing Vocabulary
</li><li> Changeset Vocabulary
</li></ul>
<p>We selected OPM as the reference provenance model.  First, because OPM is a general and broad model that encompasses many aspects of provenance.  Second, it already represents a community effort that spans several years and is still ongoing, already benefiting from many discussions, practical use, and several versions.  Finally, many groups are already undergoing efforts to map their vocabularies to OPM, and in addition there are already some mappings (called profiles in OPM) developed by the OPM group to some existing vocabularies.  There was a consensus in using OPM, and a clear sense that the effort involved in designing mappings to OPM would be manageable and at the same time very useful to the community.
</p><p>Briefly, OPM is used to describe histories in terms of <i>processes</i> (things happening), <i>artifacts</i> (what things happen to), and <i>agents</i> (what controls things happening).  These three are kinds of nodes within a graph, where each edge denotes a causal relationship.  Edges have named types depending on the kinds of node they relate: a process <i>used</i> an artifact; an artifact <i>was generated by</i> a process; one artifact <i>was derived from</i> another artifact; one process <i>was triggered by</i> another process; a process <i>was controlled by</i> an agent.  As records of the same occurrences may be observed by different actors and/or from different perspectives, OPM allows subgraphs to belong to one or more <i>accounts</i>.
</p><p>We agreed to make the mappings as formal as possible.  We agreed to use <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos">SKOS</a> terms (skos:broader  skos:narrower  skos:related) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview">OWL2</a> terms (owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty) to indicate the mapping.  To this end, we used a prefix for each of the models and vocabularies.
</p><p>We created a single table with concise proposals for all the mappings.  To complement the table, we wrote detailed notes about the mappings summarized in the table.

<a name="Provenance_Vocabulary" id="Provenance_Vocabulary"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Provenance Vocabulary</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://purl.org/net/provenance/" class="external text" title="http://purl.org/net/provenance/">The Provenance Vocabulary</a> was developed to describe provenance of Linked Data on the Web. The openness of the Web of Linked Data allows everyone to publish anything. Applications that are based on data from the Web have to evaluate the provenance of this data in order to estimate its reliability. To obtain such provenance information the applications rely on provenance-related metadata from third parties, e.g. the data providers. However, <a href="http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2009/papers/ldow2009_paper18.pdf" class="external text" title="http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2009/papers/ldow2009_paper18.pdf">a recent study</a> revealed a general lack of provenance-related metadata about Linked Data on the Web. One reason - among others - might be the lack of suitable vocabularies to describe provenance of Linked Data. The Provenance Vocabulary aims to fill this void.
</p><p>The Provenance Vocabulary is defined as an OWL ontology and it is partitioned into a <a href="http://purl.org/net/provenance/ns" class="external text" title="http://purl.org/net/provenance/ns">core ontology</a> and supplementary modules. To avoid making the core ontology too complex the modules provide less frequently used concepts and a broad range of specializations of the core concepts. At present the Provenance Vocabulary provides three supplementary modules: <a href="http://purl.org/net/provenance/types" class="external text" title="http://purl.org/net/provenance/types">Types</a>, <a href="http://purl.org/net/provenance/files" class="external text" title="http://purl.org/net/provenance/files">Files</a> and <a href="http://purl.org/net/provenance/integrity" class="external text" title="http://purl.org/net/provenance/integrity">Integrity Verification</a>.
</p><p>The development of the Provenance Vocabulary was motivated by the need to describe the main aspects of provenance of data consumed from the Web. The authors of the vocabulary identified two main dimensions of provenance that are typical in this context: data creation and data access. Some, more general concepts, such as actors, processes, and artifacts, are relevant in both these dimensions. Consequently, the Provenance Vocabulary consists of three parts: general terms, terms for data creation, and terms for data access. Detailed information about using the Provenance Vocabulary and many examples can be found in the <a href="http://purl.org/net/provenance/guide" class="external text" title="http://purl.org/net/provenance/guide">Guide to the Provenance Vocabulary</a>.

<td><b>Mapping</b>
</td><td><b>Explanation</b>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlj:InferenceStep is a <i>relatedMatch</i> to opm:Process
</td><td>Both terms refer to a specific execution of a process. While the term InferenceStep might seem to imply a subtype of step, it is used broadly to apply to many types of mathematical/computational process executions as well as logical inference and thus appears to be a match for opm:Process
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlp:Information is a <i>closeMatch</i> to opm:Artifact
</td><td>Information "supports references to information at various levels of granularity and structure" and is used in examples to represent text strings and scientific data files and thus appears to be a close match to the opm:Artifact concept
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlp:Source is <i>related</i> to opm:Artifact
</td><td>Source appears to be used both for things that would map to opm:Artifact (i.e. Documents, web pages) as well as opm:Agents (i.e. an agent/person). Sources are associated with Information that comes from them (hasSourceUsage), which, as discussed later, appears to be a form of opm:wasDerivedFrom relation where the 'usage' process is not described.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlp:Agent is <i>narrower</i> than opm:Agent
</td><td>pmlp:Agent is a subtype of Source and thus does not have an association with a Process as in opm. However, as a source, pmlp:Agents do appear to control undescribed processes resulting in Information that can be inputs (antecedent to) INferenceSteps. Thus pmlp:Agent appears narrower than opm:Agent. opm:Agent also appears to be used more broadly for non-human agents than pmlp:Agent, e.g. with an oven controlling a baking process. pmlp:Source thus appears to have overlap with opm:Agent as well (e.g. if ovens can be pmlp:Sources of cakes)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlj:NodeSet is <i>narrower</i> than opm:Account
</td><td>NodeSet describes a set of InferenceSteps, Information, and Sources leading to a conclusion. It thus appears to serve a similar role to opm:Account as a way to aggregate information provided by a witness. It's narrower in that Account does not require causal connections between all the artifacts and processes being reported.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlp:hasSourceUsage is <i>narrower</i> than opm:wasDerivedFrom
</td><td>PML doesn't appear to have a general causal connection between pmlp:Information instances but does provide such a link between Sources (which can be documents) and Information (i.e. a text string from that document).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlj:hasAntecedentList is a <i>relatedMatch</i> to opm:Used
</td><td>The antecedent list documents the inputs to an InferenceStep and thus appears to be similar to opm:used. The list is ordered whereas opm:used provides roles, so the match is not exact.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlj:IsConsequentOf is a <i>relatedMatch</i> to opm:wasGeneratedBy
</td><td>InferenceSteps create Information which is a result of that step. It thus appears to mirror the opm wasGeneratedBy relationship of process and artifact. In PML, NodeSets may also have pmlp:hasConclusion relationships with Information, which appears to make it related to wasGeneratedBy in some sense (NodeSet as an aggregate opm:Process).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pmlp:hasSourceUsage is <i>related</i> to opm:wasControlledBy
</td><td>hasSourceUsage when the Source is an Agent appears to imply that the Agent controlled some process by which the output Information was created.
</td></tr>
<tr>

<p>Provenance Vocabulary terms not mentioned in the mapping yet: 
PML 2 has a broad range of concepts and relationships that are outside the scope of OPM. These include specific properties describing and structuring artifacts, agents/sources, and processes/InferenceSteps, some of which appear to overlap Dublin Core, some of which appear to be text related (e.g. Information that "hasRawString"), and some of which describe the algoritm and environment in which processes (process events) occur (e.g. describing InferenceEngines and InferenceRules). PML also includes a Trust vocabulary that documents beliefs/trust in sources that is not covered in OPM.
</p><p>One other note: While the provenance of PML in the semantic web is clear in the choice of names (e.g. InferenceEngines), there are numerous examples where PML has been applied to non-text data and non-logic-based processing and thus the underlying term definitions do not appear restrictive.

<p><a href="http://dublincore.org/" class="external text" title="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> Metadata Terms provide a means to describe resources such that others will be able to interpret those descriptions.  In particular, it provides a common vocabulary of core terms which can act as metadata keys, qualifications of those terms for specific applications, definitions of data types for the values of resource metadata, and so on. Amongst the terms available are many which relate to the provenance of the resource: who created it, when it was changed, etc.

<a name="Conclusions" id="Conclusions"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusions</span></h1>
<p>This document reports on the W3C Provenance Incubator Group's mapping approach between a set of core provenance terms and several provenance-related models and vocabularies. As core provenance terms we selected the provenance-related terms in OPM. While we were aware of the potential limitations such a predefinition would involve it turned out to be right choice for this first attempt to identify correspondences between existing provenance terminologies. Choosing OPM terms allowed us to focus on defining the mapping instead of discussing what qualifies as common provenance terms. Such a discussion could have deviated too easily into the development of another model, which was not our aim. Instead, the conducted mapping exercise enables a better understanding of the differences and similarities of the existing models.
</p><p>Our first finding is that many of the considered models and vocabularies have a set of core concepts that correspond to the notion of processes, artifacts, and agents as defined in OPM. These concepts can be mapped quite naturally between the models.
While the modeling of these concepts indicates a process-centric view, several vocabularies take a resource-centric view. Specifying the mappings for these resource-centric vocabularies was more difficult. In particular, we experienced such difficulties for vocabularies that use relationships between entities as "shortcuts" for a detailed process descriptions. It is understandable that, particularly in the workflow provenance context, it is very important and mostly feasible to explicitly describe the process involved in causing the existence of a resource. However, it might not always be the case. For example, when expressing that some brain tissues were obtained from disease centers, it might be sufficient to say that some tissues were contributed by a specific disease center. Although, a provenance description could introduce a process that represents the contribution process, it would make things more verbose than necessary. Hence, resource-centric terms are important shortcuts to complement process-centric provenance vocabularies; they allow for a more compact representation of provenance which is more intuitive in some cases.
</p><p>Several vocabularies provide non-causal relationships, something explicitly left out of OPM. For instance, Provenir includes the property provenir:preceded_by to represent temporal order or provenir:adjacent_to for spatial proximity; the Provenance Vocabulary allows users to describe who was responsible for a data providing service that was accessed during the execution of a data access process. While it can be argued whether such relationships are provenance related or not, they may be of great value in several application areas of provenance descriptions such as provenance based measurement of trustworthiness of content or information quality assessment in general. However, the definition of non-causal relationships in provenance vocabularies should ensure that no conflict with causality can result.
</p><p>While many vocabularies provide time related terms, the time dimension is not represented in our mapping. The main reason for this lack was that OPM does not represent time related properties explicitly as one of the terms defined for node types and their relationships. While OPM enables the specification of time constraints using timestamps attached to relationships, we selected only the node types and relationships in OPM as our core provenance terms.
</p><p>Further aspects of provenance that are not well captured by OPM and, thus, missing from the core provenance terms are:
</p>
<ul><li> versioning,
</li><li> a notion of artifact identity that persists across transformations,
</li><li> containment relationships and collections, and
</li><li> cryptographic hashes and digital signatures.
</li></ul>
<p>Some of the considered vocabularies introduce rich sets of useful concepts for these aspects. In many cases these concepts can be seen as sub-types of OPM terms. To preserve their rich expressiveness, a systematic structuring of these concepts, per application domain, in the form of OPM profiles, would be necessary. Similarly, better bridges between OPM and vocabularies that are already standardized and strongly adopted (e.g. Dublin Core), but do not have the full expressiveness of OPM, would be desirable.
</p><p>The presented work could be developed further into two main directions. First, the work on the mappings could be continued and made more formal. While we decided to use the SKOS vocabulary to describe the mappings it would have been possible to even use more precise relationships (e.g. rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass) in some cases. In other cases a more expressible mapping language would be required, rendering the formalization into a substantial activity. Additionally, the presented mapping could be complemented by a reverse mapping from the core provenance terms to each provenance vocabulary.
An alternative direction would be the evolution of the selected set of core provenance terms into a more comprehensive set which also models aspects of provenance that are currently missing from the core terms. This project would basically entail the discussions we wanted to avoid to complete the presented mapping. However, the result and the lessons learned from our mapping exercise would be a valuable input to such an endeavor.
